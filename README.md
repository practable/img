# img
Images for using in profile, documentation, etc.

The preferred way to include images in the organisational README is via an `<img></img>` link, e.g.
```
<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practable/img/main/logo.png"alt="Practable logo with three hexagons and tagline: non-traditional practical work" style="width:40%">
</figure>
```

## Logos

If you are adopting/contributing and would like your institution logo to appear in the README.md, then make a PR to include your logo in this repo.
